comment|/**  * A PlanFollower is a component that runs on a timer, and synchronizes the  * underlying {@link ResourceScheduler} with the {@link Plan}(s) and viceversa.  *   * While different implementations might operate differently, the key idea is to  * map the current allocation of resources for each active reservation in the  * plan(s), to a corresponding notion in the underlying scheduler (e.g., tuning  * capacity of queues, set pool weights, or tweak application priorities). The  * goal is to affect the dynamic allocation of resources done by the scheduler  * so that the jobs obtain access to resources in a way that is consistent with  * the reservations in the plan. A key conceptual step here is to convert the  * absolute-valued promises made in the reservations to appropriate relative  * priorities/queue sizes etc.  *   * Symmetrically the PlanFollower exposes changes in cluster conditions (as  * tracked by the scheduler) to the plan, e.g., the overall amount of physical  * resources available. The Plan in turn can react by replanning its allocations  * if appropriate.  *   * The implementation can assume that is run frequently enough to be able to  * observe and react to normal operational changes in cluster conditions on the  * fly (e.g., if cluster resources drop, we can update the relative weights of a  * queue so that the absolute promises made to the job at reservation time are  * respected).  *   * However, due to RM restarts and the related downtime, it is advisable for  * implementations to operate in a stateless way, and be able to synchronize the  * state of plans/scheduler regardless of how big is the time gap between  * executions.  */
