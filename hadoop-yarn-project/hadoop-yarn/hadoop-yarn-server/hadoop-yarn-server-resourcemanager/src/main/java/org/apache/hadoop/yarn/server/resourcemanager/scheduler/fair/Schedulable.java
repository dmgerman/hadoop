comment|/**  * A Schedulable represents an entity that can be scheduled such as an  * application or a queue. It provides a common interface so that algorithms  * such as fair sharing can be applied both within a queue and across queues.  *  * A Schedulable is responsible for three roles:  * 1) Assign resources through {@link #assignContainer}.  * 2) It provides information about the app/queue to the scheduler, including:  *    - Demand (maximum number of tasks required)  *    - Minimum share (for queues)  *    - Job/queue weight (for fair sharing)  *    - Start time and priority (for FIFO)  * 3) It can be assigned a fair share, for use with fair scheduling.  *  * Schedulable also contains two methods for performing scheduling computations:  * - updateDemand() is called periodically to compute the demand of the various  *   jobs and queues, which may be expensive (e.g. jobs must iterate through all  *   their tasks to count failed tasks, tasks that can be speculated, etc).  * - redistributeShare() is called after demands are updated and a Schedulable's  *   fair share has been set by its parent to let it distribute its share among  *   the other Schedulables within it (e.g. for queues that want to perform fair  *   sharing among their jobs).  */
