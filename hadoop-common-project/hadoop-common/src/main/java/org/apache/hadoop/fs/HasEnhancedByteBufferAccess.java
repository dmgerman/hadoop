comment|/**    * Get a ByteBuffer containing file data.    *    * This ByteBuffer may come from the stream itself, via a call like mmap,    * or it may come from the ByteBufferFactory which is passed in as an    * argument.    *    * @param factory    *            If this is non-null, it will be used to create a fallback    *            ByteBuffer when the stream itself cannot create one.    * @param maxLength    *            The maximum length of buffer to return.  We may return a buffer    *            which is shorter than this.    * @param opts    *            Options to use when reading.    *    * @return    *            We will always return an empty buffer if maxLength was 0,    *            whether or not we are at EOF.    *            If maxLength> 0, we will return null if the stream has    *            reached EOF.    *            Otherwise, we will return a ByteBuffer containing at least one     *            byte.  You must free this ByteBuffer when you are done with it     *            by calling releaseBuffer on it.  The buffer will continue to be    *            readable until it is released in this manner.  However, the    *            input stream's close method may warn about unclosed buffers.    * @throws    *            IOException: if there was an error reading.    *            UnsupportedOperationException: if factory was null, and we    *            needed an external byte buffer.  UnsupportedOperationException    *            will never be thrown unless the factory argument is null.    */
