comment|/**    * Resolves a list of DNS-names/IP-addresses and returns back a list of    * switch information (network paths). One-to-one correspondence must be     * maintained between the elements in the lists.     * Consider an element in the argument list - x.y.com. The switch information    * that is returned must be a network path of the form /foo/rack,     * where / is the root, and 'foo' is the switch where 'rack' is connected.    * Note the hostname/ip-address is not part of the returned path.    * The network topology of the cluster would determine the number of    * components in the network path.    *<p/>    *    * If a name cannot be resolved to a rack, the implementation    * should return {@link NetworkTopology#DEFAULT_RACK}. This    * is what the bundled implementations do, though it is not a formal requirement    *    * @param names the list of hosts to resolve (can be empty)    * @return list of resolved network paths.    * If<i>names</i> is empty, the returned list is also empty    */
