comment|/**    * Reads up to buf.remaining() bytes into buf. Callers should use    * buf.limit(..) to control the size of the desired read.    *<p/>    * After a successful call, buf.position() will be advanced by the number     * of bytes read and buf.limit() should be unchanged.    *<p/>    * In the case of an exception, the values of buf.position() and buf.limit()    * are undefined, and callers should be prepared to recover from this    * eventuality.    *<p/>    * Many implementations will throw {@link UnsupportedOperationException}, so    * callers that are not confident in support for this method from the    * underlying filesystem should be prepared to handle that exception.    *<p/>    * Implementations should treat 0-length requests as legitimate, and must not    * signal an error upon their receipt.    *    * @param buf    *          the ByteBuffer to receive the results of the read operation.    * @return the number of bytes read, possibly zero, or -1 if     *         reach end-of-stream    * @throws IOException    *           if there is some error performing the read    */
